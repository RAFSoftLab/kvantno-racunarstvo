    "## Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a core component of many quantum algorithms. It transforms a basis state into a superposition of all possible states, each with a distinct phase. This makes it a powerful tool for uncovering hidden patterns, periodic repetitions, or unknown phases. The standard implementation of the QFT is based on the Coppersmith formula [1]:\n",

    "Here, the first qubit factor depends on the **least significant bit** $x_{0}$, and each subsequent factor accumulates more bits from right to left.\n",

    "However, in the quantum computing literature, the more common textbook interpretation is given by Nielsen & Chuang [2]. In this interpretation, the first qubit factor depends on the **most significant bit** $x_{n-1}$, and each subsequent factor accumulates more bits from left to right:\n",

    "Each term in these formulas represents a single qubit prepared in a superposition of the form $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle + e^{i\\varphi}|1\\rangle\\right) $. The relative phase $e^{i\\varphi}$ of the $|1\\rangle$ component is determined by a binary fraction.  As we move from the most significant to the least significant qubit (in the Nielsen & Chuang convention), each subsequent qubit carries a phase shift with finer resolution, differing by multiples of $1/2^k$.  Thus, the terms are written in order from the largest to the smallest phase contributions.  \n",
    "Consequently, on each qubit line, the construction applies an H gate followed by a sequence of controlled phase gates ($P$ gates).  As we move upward through the circuit, each qubit receives one more $P$ gate than the one below it, corresponding to the binary digits that control the accumulated phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both conventions, the qubits end up in **reversed order** compared to the canonical Fourier basis. Therefore, **a sequence of SWAP gates** is usually added at the end of the QFT circuit to restore the correct ordering of qubits.\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a `qft` function that creates an n-qubit circuit following the textbook (Nielsen & Chuang) style.\n",
    "- Implement the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform circuit `iqft`, based on the previous function.  \n",
    "- Demonstrate a QFT → IQFT round-trip on at least one basis state and report counts concentrating on the original bitstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drawn circuits for the QFT and the inverse QFT.  \n",
    "- A demonstration of the QFT → IQFT round-trip on a chosen basis state.  \n",
    "- Measurement results showing counts concentrated on the original bitstring, confirming correctness of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the `qft` function with different numbers of qubits and compare the circuit depth and structure in textbook versus bottom-up style.  \n",
    "- Apply the QFT to various input states (e.g., computational basis states or superposition states) and observe the resulting measurement distributions.  \n",
    "- Explore how the presence or absence of the final SWAP gates affects the ordering of the output states.  \n",
    "- Verify the correctness of the `iqft` by composing QFT → IQFT for different inputs and confirming recovery of the original state.  \n",
    "- Implement a `qft` function that creates an n-qubit circuit following the **Coppersmith (bottom-up)** style.\n",
