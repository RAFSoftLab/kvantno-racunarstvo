    "## QCLab: Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm – Constant or Balanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm was the first quantum algorithm to show an **exponential separation** (speedup) between quantum and classical computation. It solves the problem of determining whether a Boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is constant** or balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function $f : \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ is:\n",
    "  - **constant** if it returns the same output (always 0 or always 1) for all inputs.\n",
    "  - **balanced** if it returns 0 for exactly half of the inputs, and 1 for the other half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, in the worst case one needs to evaluate the function $f$ on $2^{n-1}+1$ different inputs to be certain whether $f$ is constant or balanced.  \n",
    "The quantum version solves the problem with **just one evaluation** of the oracle by exploiting superposition and interference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm (shown in the figure) prepares the input qubits in superposition using Hadamard gates, applies the oracle $O_f$ that encodes the function $f$, and then uses another layer of Hadamards to create interference.  \n",
    "Measuring the first $n$ qubits reveals whether $f$ is constant (all 0s) or balanced (at least one qubit measured as 1).\n",

    "- A histogram of the measurement results.  \n",
    "- A printout of the measurement results dictionary.  \n",
    "- A message indicating the function type and the algorithm’s finding: constant or balanced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try running the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm with different oracles that implement constant and balanced functions.  \n",
    "- Compare the measurement histograms: constant functions should always yield the all-zero state, while balanced functions will produce non-zero bitstrings.  \n",
    "- Verify that, regardless of $n$, the quantum algorithm needs only one oracle call to distinguish the two cases.  \n",
    "- Modify the circuit to use even more input qubits and observe how the results scale.  \n"
