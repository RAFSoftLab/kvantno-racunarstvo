    "## Wiesner’s Quantum Money (Proof of Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stephen Wiesner invented the concept of **quantum money** in 1968, an idea that remains unimplemented in real-world quantum systems due to the lack of quantum memory, which is simulated in this Lab. The central idea is that a banknote can be represented by a qubit prepared in one of two possible bases (computational or Hadamard). Because unknown quantum states cannot be cloned (no-cloning theorem), counterfeit banknotes cannot be forged reliably. Each quantum coin is issued together with a unique **serial number**, which is recorded in the bank’s ledger. This serial number serves as the identifier that links the quantum coin held by the user to the corresponding preparation record stored by the bank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Wiesner’s original proposal, the bank records only the secret preparation basis for each qubit, which is later used to verify authenticity. In this simulation, both the preparation label and the actual quantum state are stored in the bank’s ledger. This allows verification to be performed by directly comparing the fidelity of the received coin with the bank’s reference state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![QuantumMoney](images/QuantumMoney.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This proof-of-concept simulation illustrates:\n",
    "- **Coin creation:** The bank randomly chooses one of four states ($\\lvert 0\\rangle, \\lvert 1\\rangle, \\lvert +\\rangle, \\lvert -\\rangle$) and stores it in the bank ledger.  \n",
    "- **Wallets:** Alice and Bob each have a “wallet” to hold their quantum coins.  \n",
    "- **Issuing:** Alice can request coins from the bank.  \n",
    "- **Verification:** Coins are checked against the bank’s reference state using fidelity.  \n",
    "- **Transfer:** Coins may be transferred between Alice and Bob if they pass verification.  \n",

    "### Task\n",
    "1. Run the program to observe how a qubit, representing a quantum coin, is issued, stored in a wallet, and transferred.  \n",
    "2. Study the functions and understand how:  \n",
    "   - `prepare_coin_state` generates the qubit state,  \n",
    "   - `create_quantum_coin_pair` creates the bank copy and the user copy,  \n",
    "   - `verify_coin` checks authenticity using fidelity.  \n",
    "3. Provide an explanation of why fidelity is necessary in verification and why a qubit cannot be copied classically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "When the program is executed, the bank issues two coins to Alice and records their serial numbers.  \n",
    "Alice’s wallet initially contains both coins, while Bob’s wallet is empty.  \n",
    "After a valid transfer, one coin is successfully moved from Alice’s wallet to Bob’s, with the fidelity value confirming its authenticity.  \n",
    "The final state is that Alice retains one coin and Bob holds the transferred coin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If tampering or errors are introduced before verification, the fidelity drops below the acceptance threshold.  \n",
    "In this case, the transfer attempt fails, the coin is rejected, and it remains recorded in Alice’s wallet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "Possible extensions of the program include:  \n",
    "- Issuing additional coins and observing how unique serial numbers are generated.  \n",
    "- Introducing deliberate tampering by applying random gates (e.g., `x`, `h`) to user coins before verification, and checking how fidelity changes.  \n",
    "- Adjusting the fidelity threshold (currently set to `0.99`) to explore its effect on acceptance or rejection.  \n",
    "- Allowing Bob to request coins directly from the bank.  \n",
    "- Extending the system to **multi-qubit coins** by modifying `prepare_coin_state` to handle more than one qubit.  \n",
    "- Recording all transactions in a log to simulate a basic blockchain-style ledger for quantum money.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection question:**  \n",
    "Why does the no-cloning theorem make it impossible for a counterfeiter to copy a quantum coin with perfect fidelity?  \n"
