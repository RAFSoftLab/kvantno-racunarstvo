    "## Grover’s Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover’s algorithm is a quantum search procedure that efficiently finds a marked item within an unsorted set, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search (classical $O(N)$ vs. quantum $O(\\sqrt{N})$. It works by amplifying the probability of the target state using repeated applications of the **oracle** (which marks the target by flipping its phase) and the **diffuser** (which performs inversion about the mean).  \n",
    "\n",
    "![GroverAlgorithm](images/GroverAlgorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grover’s algorithm begins by applying Hadamard gates (H) to all qubits, creating a uniform superposition where every basis state has equal probability.\n",
    "- The Oracle (O) step inverts the amplitude of the marked state, effectively “tagging” the solution without changing its probability.\n",
    "- The Diffuser (D) then performs an inversion about the mean, which boosts the amplitude of the marked state while suppressing all others.\n",
    "- Repeating the Oracle and Diffuser together forms a **Grover iteration**, and each iteration further increases the probability of observing the marked state. The optimal number of iterations is given by  \n",
    "  $k = \\left\\lfloor \\tfrac{\\pi}{4} \\sqrt{\\tfrac{N}{M}} \\right\\rfloor$,  \n",
    "  where $N = 2^n$ is the total number of states and $M$ is the number of marked states.\n",
    "- Finally, a measurement is performed. Because the amplitude of the marked state has been maximized, measuring the system yields the correct solution with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "- Design and run a Grover’s search circuit for an $n$-qubit system, where $n$ is determined by the length of a user-specified binary target string (e.g., `1011`).  \n",
    "- The oracle should flip the phase of the target state only, while the diffuser amplifies its probability amplitude through inversion about the mean.  \n",
    "- For simplicity, construct both the oracle and the diffuser using multi-qubit controlled `mcx` gates.  \n",
    "- Run the algorithm for the optimal number of iterations to maximize the probability of measuring the target state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "- A quantum circuit diagram of the Grover search algorithm showing the oracle, diffuser, and measurement steps.  \n",
    "- A measurement histogram with probability mass concentrated on the target state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "- Modify the code to allow multiple marked states and adjust the number of Grover iterations accordingly.  \n",
    "- Compare results for different numbers of iterations to observe under‑rotation and over‑rotation effects.\n"
